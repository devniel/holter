## üìö Learn More

The project is done with Next.js (a full-stack React framework), ideal for MVPs and production-grade projects.

For the Holter Record Summary, the back-end service is located in `src/app/api`, all the rest is front-end but it uses Next.js back-end capabilities (e.g. Server Side Rendering).

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
